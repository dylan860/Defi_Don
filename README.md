# Project 3 

# This is a ERC20 Token built on the Ethereum Blockchain.

- The token will be decentralized, meaning that it will not be controlled by any single entity.
- The token will be tied to the performance of the Python code, meaning that the value of the token will go up or down depending on how well the code performs.
- The token will be used to purchase goods and services on a web-based platform.
- The token will also be used to vote on decisions related to the development of the platform.

# We are building Web3 interface that will allow you buy and sell Don_Fortune Token on the Ethereum Blockchain.
- we are using streamlit to build an decentralized application
- we are using solidity to launch and deploy the Token
